Enum:
It is a special type of blueprint where the number of objects are specified at the time of creation of blueprint itself.
Enum is a group of constants. It is used to limit the choice of data user can input.
When we know the values are restricted, we can go for an enum.

//Size.SMALL is the enum. And, internally it has some string values corresponding to it.

The enum value of "SMALL" can be found with the valueOf().
Similarly, the String value(version) of an enum can be found with Size.SMALL.name().

** We cannot create the objects of Enum. Because the constructors are private to the enum itself.

We can bind enum objects with properties. While creating enum, it is important to bind the properties with the constructors
to the objects.

We are not making calls to the Enum constructor from the psvm. Some body will be making the call to the constructor.
We just made the order that SMALL is the object name. Someone will be creating the call to the constructor. The parameter
passed while calling the constructor will be stored in the property sizeNumber. This property is used for inter-conversions.
That is 1 to small and small to 1.

We can use an Enum to create the list of country codes of all countries that takes fixed values only.
